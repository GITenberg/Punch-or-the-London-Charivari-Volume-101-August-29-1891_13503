             alt="Mr. Higlinson." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>As you stood before the automatic machine on the station
    platform, making an imbecile choice between a packet of
    gooseberry nougat and a slab of the gum caramel, you could not
    help seeing on the level of your eye this
    notice:&mdash;"BLACKING-CREAM. ASK FOR HIGLINSON'S, AND TAKE NO
    OTHER."</p>

    <p>Similar announcements met you on every hoarding, in almost
    every paper and magazine, on every omnibus. Neat little packets
    of HIGLINSON's Blacking-cream were dropped through your
    letter-box, with a printed request that you would honour Mr.
    HIGLINSON by trying it. Leaflets were handed you in the street
    to tell you what public analysts said about it, and in what
    great hotels it was the only blacking used. Importunity pays.
    Sooner or later you bought HIGLINSON's Blacking-cream. You then
    found out that it was just about as good as any other, and went
    on buying it.</p>

    <p>In one way this was very good for Mr. HIGLINSON, because he
    became very rich; in other ways it was not so good for him. For
    a long time he had nothing to do with public life; the public
    never thought about his existence; to the public he was not a
    man at all&mdash;he was only part of the name of the stuff they
    used for their boots. If he had introduced himself to a
    stranger, giving the name of HIGLINSON, it is probable that the
    stranger would have remarked jocularly, "No relation to the
    Blacking-cream, I presume?" HIGLINSON knew this, and it pained
    him deeply, for he was a sensitive man.</p>

    <p>Because he was sensitive and felt things so much, he wrote a
    volume of very melancholy verses. He was unmarried and lonely,
    and he wanted to lead a high life. He said as much in his
    verses. But what comes well from Sir GALAHAD comes ill from the
    proprietor of a Blacking-cream; and&mdash;from idiotic notions
    about pluck and honesty&mdash;he had put his own name to his
    book. Unfortunately, those who feel much are not always those
    who can express much; and HIGLINSON could not express anything.
    So critics with a light mind had a very fine time with these
    verses. They quoted them, with the prefatory remark:&mdash;"The
    cream of the collection&mdash;perhaps we might say the
    Blacking-cream of the collection&mdash;is the following," and
    they wound up their criticism with saying that the book must
    have been simply published as an advertisement. Mr. HIGLINSON
    could hardly have been mad enough to have printed such stuff
    from any other motive.</p>

    <p>Of course HIGLINSON should have changed his name, and should
    have married. But the idiotic notions about pluck prevented him
    from changing his name; and he would not marry a woman who
    accepted him from only mercenary motives. He was so
    unattractive that he did not think it possible a woman would
    marry him for any other reason. However, he could not always be
    superintending the manufacture of Blacking-cream; and it was
    obvious to him that he could publish no more verses. So he
    devoted himself to philanthropy in a quiet and unostentatious
    way. He attempted the reclamation of street-arabs. He worked
    among them. He spent vast sums on providing education,
    training, and decent pleasures for them. A man who wrote for
    <i>The Scalpel</i> found him out at last. Next day there was a
    pretty little paragraph in <i>The Scalpel</i>, showing Mr.
    HIGLINSON up, and suggesting that this was a clever attempt to
    get the London shoe-blacks to use HIGLINSON's Blacking-cream.
    The Blacking-cream, by the way, had never been advertised in
    <i>The Scalpel</i>.</p>

    <p>HIGLINSON was furious. He spent a little money in finding
    out who had written the paragraph. Then he walked up to the
    writer in a public street, with raised walking-stick. "Now,
    Sir," he said, "you shall have the thrashing that you
    deserve."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/97-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/97-2.png"
             alt="Mr. Higlinson jumps from bridge." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>But it happened that the writer was physically superior to
    HIGLINSON; so it was the writer who did the thrashing, and
    HIGLINSON who took it. Next day, <i>The Scalpel</i> amused
    itself with HIGLINSON to the extent of half a column. The
    notice was headed:&mdash;</p>

    <center>
        "MR. HIGLINSON ADVERTISES HIMSELF AGAIN."
    </center>

    <p>Other newspapers also amused themselves, and HIGLINSON
    became notorious. The Blacking-cream sold better than ever, and
    brought him enormous profits. But if he attempted to spend
    those profits on any object, good or bad, it was always
    insisted that he was simply doing it for advertisement. The
    public became interested in HIGLINSON; and untrue stories about
    his private life appeared freely in personal columns. He was
    rich enough now to have relinquished his business, but those
    idiotic notions about pluck prevented him from doing this. He
    meant to go through with it, and to make the public believe in
    him just as much as they believed in the Blacking-cream. He
    found about this time someone who did believe in him; he began
    to change his views about marriage; he was to some extent
    consoled.</p>

    <p>He was passing over the bridge one night, and had just
    bought an evening paper. His own name caught his eye. It was
    the usual paragraph, not more hateful to him than others that
    had appeared, as far as he himself was concerned; but her name
    was in it as well, and he imagined to himself just how she
    would feel when she read it. He walked on a few paces, and then
    his pluck all vanished suddenly, as if it had been blown away
    into space, and it did not seem to be worth while to stop in
    such a world any longer.</p>

    <p>The jury returned the usual verdict; but <i>The Scalpel</i>
    did not hesitate to hint that this suicide had simply been
    intended as an advertisement, and that HIGLINSON had always
    supposed that his rescue would be a certainty.</p>

    <p>He might have saved himself all this, of course, by a few
    full-page advertisements in <i>The Scalpel</i>. But then he had
    those idiotic notions about pluck, and he was reluctant to
    bribe his enemies. It is a very dangerous thing to have notions
    about anything.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The Baron's Assistant Reader reports as follows to his
    chief&mdash;If you want a really refreshing book, a book whose
    piquant savour and quaint originality of style are good for
    jaded brains, buy and read <i>In a Canadian Canoe</i> by BARRY
    PAIN, the sixth volume of the Whitefriars Library of Wit and
    Humour (HENRY &amp; Co.). Most of the stories and, I think, the
    best that go to make up this delightful volume have already
    appeared in <i>The Granta</i>, a Cambridge magazine, which
    London papers are accustomed to speak of as "our sprightly
    contemporary." They now seek and are sure to obtain a wider
    public and a more extended fame. There is in these stories a
    curious mixture of humour, insight and pathos, with here and
    there a dash of grimness and a sprinkling of that charming
    irrelevancy which is of the essence of true humour.
    Occasionally Mr. BARRY PAIN wings a shaft against the
    comfortably brutal doctrines of the average and orthodox
    householder, male or female. But on these occasions he uses the
    classical fables and the pagan deities as his bow, and the
    twang of his shot cannot offend those who play the part of
    target and are pierced. Read the four stories from the
    "Entertainments of Kapnides" in the "Canadian Canoe" series,
    or, "An Hour of Death," "The Last Straw," and "Number One
    Hundred and Three" in "The Nine Muses Minus One," and you will
    see at once what I mean. Then for run-away, topsy-turvey wit I
    think I would back "The Story of the Tin Heart" and "The Camel
    who never got Started," against most stories I know. Mr. BARRY
    PAIN's stories sometimes make me feel as if I had got hold of
    the key-handle of things which have hitherto been puzzles to
    me. I turn it, open the door ever so little to peep inside, and
    before I have taken a good square look, Mr. BARRY PAIN slams
    the door in my face, and I think I can hear him laughing on the
    other side at the bruise on my forehead. That's not kind
    treatment, but it promotes curiosity. As for "The Celestial
    Grocery," I can only say of it that it is in its way a
    masterpiece. Mr. PAIN sometimes gives way to a touch or two of
    sentiment, but he abstains from sloppiness. His book is not
    only witty and humorous but fresh and original in style. It is
    admirably written. His prose is good,&mdash;which is moderate
    praise, striking a balance between the <i>pros</i> and
    <i>cons</i> of criticism. <i>Prosit!</i> To all holiday-makers
    who like quaintness and fun touched with pathos and refinement,
    I say again, buy and read <i>In a Canadian Canoe</i>.</p>

    <h2>THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. IV.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Wiertz Museum at Brussels, a large
        and well-lighted gallery containing the works of the
        celebrated Belgian, which are reducing a limited number of
        spectators to the usual degree of stupefaction. Enter</i>
        CULCHARD, <i>who seats himself on a central
        ottoman.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If PODBURY won't come
    down to breakfast at a decent hour, he can't complain if
    I&mdash;I wonder if he heard Miss TROTTER say she was thinking
    of coming here this morning. Somehow, I <i>should</i> like that
    girl to have a more correct comprehension of my character. I
    don't so much mind her thinking me fastidious and exclusive. I
    daresay I <i>am</i>&mdash;but I <i>do</i> object to being made
    out a hopeless melancholiac! (<i>He looks round the walls.</i>)
    So these are WIERTZ's masterpieces, eh? h'm. Strenuous,
    vigorous,&mdash;a trifle crude, perhaps. Didn't he refuse all
    offers for his pictures during his lifetime? Hardly think he
    could have been overwhelmed with applications for the one
    opposite. (<i>He regards an enormous canvas, representing a
    brawny and gigantic Achilles perforating a brown Trojan with a
    small mast.</i>) Not a dining-room picture. Still, I like his
    independence&mdash;work up rather well in a sonnet. Let me see.
    (<i>He takes out note-book and scribbles.</i>) "He scorned to
    ply his sombre brush for hire." Now if I read that to PODBURY,
    he'd pretend to think I was treating of a Shoe-black on strike!
    PODBURY is utterly deficient in reverence.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They smack their lips reverently</i>; Miss TROTTER
        <i>enters the Gallery.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>rising and going to meet her</i>). Good
    morning, Miss TROTTER. We&mdash;ah&mdash;meet again.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> That's an undeniable fact. I've left Poppa
    outside. Poppa restricts himself to exteriors wherever he
    can&mdash;says he doesn't seem to mix up his impressions so
    much that way. But you're alone, too. Where've you hitched your
    friend up?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> My friend did not rise sufficiently early to
    accompany me. And, by the way, Miss TROTTER, I should like to
    take this opportunity of disabusing your mind of
    the&mdash;er&mdash;totally false impression&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Oh, <i>that's</i> all right. I told him he
    needn't try to give me away, for I could see you weren't
    <i>that</i> kind of man!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>gratefully</i>). Your instinct was
    correct&mdash;perfectly correct. When you say "that kind of
    man," I presume you refer to the description
    my&mdash;er&mdash;friend considered it humorous to give of me
    as an unsociable hypochondriac?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, no; he didn't say just that. He
    represented you as one of the fonniest persons alive; said you
    told stories which tickled folks to death almost.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). Really, this is <i>most</i>
    unpardonable of Mr. PODBURY! To have such odious calumnies
    circulated about one behind one's back is simply too&mdash;I do
    <i>not</i> aspire to&mdash;ah&mdash;to tickle folks to
    death!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>soothingly</i>). Well, I guess there's no
    harm done. I didn't feel like being in any imminent danger of
    perishing that way in your society. You're real high-toned and
    ever so improving, and that's better than tickling; every time.
    And I want you to show me round this collection and give me a
    few notions. Seems to me there was considerable sand in WIERTZ;
    sort of spread himself around a good deal, didn't he? I
    presume, though, he slept bad, nights.</p>

    <p>(<i>She makes the tour of the Gallery, accompanied by</i>
    CULCHARD, <i>who admires her, against his better judgment, more
    and more.</i>) ... I declare if that isn't your friend Mr.
    PODBURY just come in! I believe I'll have to give you up to
    him.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). I beg you will not think it
    necessary. He&mdash;he has a guide already. <i>He</i> does not
    require my services. And, to be plain, my poor
    friend&mdash;though, an excellent fellow according to
    his&mdash;ah&mdash;lights&mdash;is a companion whose society
    occasionally amounts to a positive infliction.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I find him too chinny myself, times.
    Likely he won't notice us if we don't seem to be aware of
    him.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>piqued</i>). Perhaps I had better dismiss
    my chap, and take on CULCHARD, too?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> No, I'd just hate to have you do that. Keep

    <h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

    <h4><i>On Tour&mdash;Restauration&mdash;Method&mdash;Rapid
    Act&mdash;Patriotism&mdash;Chorus&mdash;Dinner&mdash;Forwards&mdash;Entrée&mdash;Exit&mdash;Destination.</i></h4>

    <p>With DAUBINET I soon acquire the careless habit of speaking
    any French that comes into my head, irrespective of grammar,
    genders, or idioms. If he doesn't understand it in French he
    will do so in English, or <i>vice versâ</i>. On this mutual
    comprehension system we get along as easily as the express
    does, and as easily as the boat does too, to-day,&mdash;for we
    are in luck, the weather is delicious and the sea
    propitious,&mdash;and so we arrive hungry and happy at the
    excellent buffet at the Calais Station, the praises of which I
    have sung more than once in my lifetime.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/105-1.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p>Far be it from me to draw comparisons, but I if want to
    start well and wisely for the Continong, give me the short
    sea-passage <i>viâ</i> Dover and the excellent restauration at
    Calais, with a good twenty-five minutes allowed for
    refreshment; <i>though why this interval shouldn't be extended
    to three-quarters of an hour, and less time occupied on the
    journey to Paris, I have never yet been able to ascertain.</i>
    In the not very dim and distant future no doubt it will be so.
    I record the above observation in italics, in order to attract
    the attention of all whom it may and does and ought to concern.
    Perhaps they'll kindly see to it.</p>

    <p>Our <i>déjeuner</i> at Calais is as good as it usually is at
    that haven of Restauration. After the buffeting of the waves,
    how sweet is the <i>buffet</i> of the shore. I sit down at
    once, as an old Continental-travelling hand, tell the waiter
    immediately what I am going to take, and forthwith it is
    brought; then, in advance, I command the coffee, and have my
    French money all ready in an outside-pocket, so that there
    shall be no unnecessary delay. All station-feeding is a
    fearsome pastime. You are never quite sure of the trains, and
    you never quite trust the waiter's most solemn asseveration to
    the effect that you have still so many minutes left, decreasing
    rapidly from fifteen to five, when, time being up and the food
    down, you find yourself hurrying out on to the platform,
    plunging recklessly in between the lines, uncertain as to your
    carriage, and becoming more and more hot, nervous, and
    uncomfortable up to the very last moment, when the stout guard,
    with the heavy black moustache, and the familiar bronzed
    features set off by a cap-band which once was red, bundles you
    into your proper place, bangs the door, and you are
    off,&mdash;for Paris, or wherever your destination may be.</p>

    <p>DAUBINET knows the proprietor of the restaurant, likewise
    the proprietor's good lady and good children. He has a great
    deal to say to them, always by means of working the semaphore
    with his arms and hands, as if the persons with whom he
    excitedly converses were deaf; and having lost all count of
    time, besides being in a state of considerable puzzle as to the
    existence of his appetite, he is suddenly informed by the
    head-waiter,&mdash;another of his acquaintances, for DAUBINET,
    it appears, is a constant traveller to and fro on this route,
    that if he wants, any thing he must take it at once, or he
    won't get it at all, unless he chooses to stop there and lose
    his train. So DAUBINET ladles some soup into his mouth, and
    savagely worries a huge lump of bread: then having gobbled up
    the soup in a quarter of a second, and having put away all the
    bread in another quarter, he pours a glass of wine into a
    tumbler out of the bottle which I have had opened for both of
    us, adds water, then tosses it off, wipes his lips with the
    napkin which he bangs down on the table, and, with his hat and
    coat on, his small bag in his hand, and quite prepared to
    resume the journey, he cries, "<i>Allons! Petzikoff!</i>" (or
    some such word, which I suppose to be either Russian or an
    ejaculation quite new and original, but <i>à la Russe</i>, and
    entirely his own invention), with the cheery and enthusiastic
    addition of, "Blass the Prince of WAILES!"</p>

    <p>"By all means," I cordially respond, for we are on a foreign
    soil, where loyalty to our Royal Family is no longer a duty
    only, but also a mark of patriotism, which should ever
    distinguish the true Briton,&mdash;though, by the way, now I
    think of it, DAUBINET is a lively Gaul. Subsequently, observing
    my friend DAUBINET, I find that he is especially English in
    France, and peculiarly French in England. On what is to me
    foreign, but to him his own native soil, he is always bursting
    out into snatches of our British National Anthem, or he sings
    the line above quoted. In France he will insist on talking
    about London, England, Ireland, Scotland, with imitations in
    slang or of brogue, as the case may be, on every possible or
    even impossible opportunity; and, when the subject of
    conversation does not afford him any chance for his
    interpolations, then, for a time, he will "lay low," like. Brer
    Fox, only to startle us with some sudden outbursts of song,
    generally selected from the popular English Melodies of a
    byegone period, such as "<i>My Pretty Jane</i>," "<i>My Love is
    like a red, red Rose</i>," or "<i>Good-bye, Sweetheart,
    good-bye</i>," and such-like musical reminiscences, invariably
    finishing with a quotation from the National Anthem, "<i>Rule
    Britannia</i>," or "Blass the Prince of WAILES!" He is a
    travelling chorus.</p>

    <p>We stop&mdash;I don't know where, as I trust entirely to my
    guide and fellow-traveller&mdash;for a good twenty minutes'
    stuff, nominally dinner, <i>en route</i>, about seven o'clock.
    It is the usual rush; the usual indecision; the usual
    indigestion. DAUBINET does more execution among the eatables
    and drinkables in five minutes than I can manage in the full
    time allotted to refreshment; and not only this, but he finds
    plenty of time for talking nonsense to one of the
    nicest-looking waitresses. Of course, he positively refuses to
    speak a word of his own native language, but gives his orders
    in English, Spanish, and Russian, to the despair of all the
    attendants, with the exception of the pretty waiting-maid, to
    whom he addresses himself in colloquial French. She quite
    enters into the joke; can give and take as pleasantly as
    possible; can also fetch and carry; and when, finally, DAUBINET
    <i>en bon prince</i> rewards her intelligence with a two-franc
    piece, her bright smile, and her courteous "<i>Merci beaucoup,
    Monsieur</i>," prove once more that she can take as well as
    give,&mdash;nay, even better, and yet leave the donor her
    debtor. "<i>Da Karascho!</i> Yes, all right! <i>Montez
    donc!</i>" cries my mercurial friend, hurrying to the train;
    then, as he once more settles himself in the compartment, he
    sings "Rule Britannia! Blass the Prince of WAILES! O Maman!"
    and before I have lit my after-dinner cigar, he has made
    himself quite comfortable, lying at full length, and is fast
    asleep. So am I soon. When I awake, it is night; pitch-dark,
    and very cold. We are stopping at some station. A stout
    Frenchman enters our carriage; not that there is anything
    remarkable about his stoutness, as it seems to me that the
    majority of middle-class and middle-aged Frenchmen, and
    Frenchwomen, too, are all, more or less, of considerable
    corpulence.</p>

    <p>The new arrival recognises DAUBINET, and salutes him.
    DAUBINET warmly acknowledges the recognition, and in a few
    moments they are engaged in an animated conversation, one
    commencing his reply before the other has finished his
    question, neither permitting the other to complete a sentence,
    whether interrogatory or declaratory; so that, during the
    greater part of their conversation,&mdash;which lasts till,
    thank goodness, the stranger has to get out, which he does at
    the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> next station, and
       disappears in the darkness,&mdash;I can only pick up a word
       or half a sentence here and there, and, in a general way,
       wonder why they become so earnest and emphatic about the
       most ordinary topics. For an English listener, however, it
       is an excellent lesson in colloquial French; only I cannot
       help wishing that they would take the "<i>tempo</i>" just a
       little slower, and that their tone were not necessarily up
       to concert pitch, in order to keep itself well above the
       running accompaniment of railway-wheels, which seems to fit
       all modes of counting from two to sixteen in a bar. At last
       the train stops, the dialogue becomes jerky, our companion
       salutes us politely, wishes us "<i>bon voyage</i>" and
       descends.</p>

    <p>After his departure, I ask DAUBINET, "Who is your friend?"
    as I should like to know the reason of DAUBINET not having
    introduced us. His reply at once resolves all my doubts and
    difficulties on the subject; it is simply, "Heaven knows! He is
    a nice fellow. I have met him <i>quelque part. Ah! v'là!</i>"
    He rushes to the window. "Hi! hi! Guard! Conducteur!" The
    Conducteur appears, and informs us that we descend at the next
    station, and, after that, in another five minutes we shall be
    at Reims.</p>

    <p>And so we are. Reims at last! Not brilliant is Reims on this
    dark night. There are several omnibuses and other vehicles
    waiting to take the very few passengers who alight from the
    train, and who, it appears, as a rule, prefer to walk. Having
    no baggage beyond a few bags and a small portmanteau which
    travel with us in our compartment, and which the porter can
    wheel on a truck, or indeed carry if he chooses, we are soon in
    the 'bus, and rattling over the stones to the Hotel.</p>

    <p><i>Smith</i>. Nothing. Except this article upon Australia.
    Tells one all about Capital and Labour in <i>that</i> part of
    the world. Most interesting. Wonder how they found room for it!
    Have you seen it?</p>

    <p><i>Brown</i>. Well, no. Fact is I have been reading about
    Argentina. Very exhaustive article this, and on a matter of
    serious moment. I hold some shares as a trustee. Seems that
    they will all come right in the end. Would you like to see
    it?</p>

    <p><i>Smith</i>. When I have time to read it. But, to tell the
    truth, it takes me a good hour to get through the City
    Intelligence. And the racing, too, that always interests me;
    but I don't think it is so exciting as the Stock Exchange.</p>

    <p><i>Brown</i>. No more do I. By the way, is there anything
    good in the correspondence line in your paper?</p>

    <p><i>Smith</i>. The usual sensational recess subjects. Some of
    the letters are too good for the general public; they must have
    been written in the office.</p>

    <p><i>Brown</i>. I daresay. And perhaps these sketches of
    places away from Town are also written in London?</p>

    <p><i>Smith</i>. Not a bit of it! I happen to know that the
    papers spend thousands and thousands upon obtaining information
    in every quarter of the globe. Bogus articles are things of the
    past.</p>

    <p><i>Brown</i>. Only fancy! And all this expense for nothing

    <p><i>Pater</i>. (<i>cordially</i>). How are you, old chap?</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i>. Very well, thank you, Father. And will you
    forgive me&mdash;is not "chap" a trifle slangy?</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. (<i>astonished</i>). Eh! what?</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i>. You were good enough to write to my Form
    Master after the Easter Vacation, complaining of my style.
    Consequently that worthy pedagogue has given more than usual
    attention to that part of my education.</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. Well, now you are home for the holidays! As
    for your Form Master&mdash;hang him and all his works!</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i>. Are you quite sure that you are quoting
    correctly? To the best of my belief the line goes, "hang him
    with his pen and ink-horn."</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. Eh! what? I don't understand you.</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i>. Why, my dear Father, I naturally concluded
    that you were quoting; from the Immortal Bard. You will find
    the passage in <i>The Second Part of King Henry the Sixth</i>,
    scene iv., line 2.</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. What are you talking about?</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i>. Why your misquotation. And will you forgive
    me&mdash;but do you not think it would sound better if you were
    to ask me&mdash;"about what I was talking"? I might add that my
    Form Master and I&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. Your "Form Master and you." Rot and bosh! I
    should say&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i> (<i>with a twitch of pain</i>). Oh, my dear
    Father, more slang, more slang!</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. (<i>getting very red</i>). And what if there
    is? What's that to you? You don't pay for my education, do
    you?</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i> (<i>quickly</i>). No. If I did, I could not
    declare that I was satisfied with your progress!</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. (<i>indignantly</i>). You little prig,
    I&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i> (<i>calmly interrupting</i>). Pray do not
    excite yourself. I am only doing my duty. I am merely
    attempting to instruct those less polished than myself. Surely
    I may regard such an action with satisfaction?</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. (<i>furious</i>). You shall go back to school
    at once!</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i>. I am afraid that that is scarcely practicable.
    If you will refer to the slip that accompanied my school-bill,
    you will notice that the Vacation does not cease until the 20th
    of September.</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. And a nice school-bill! Why they charged
    everything as an extra!</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i>. Surely such a matter is scarcely within my
    province? According to statute, my dear Father, you are bound
    to provide for me until (if my memory does not betray me) I
    reach the age of sixteen. As I am now five years younger than
    that limit, it is clearly your duty to support me.</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. Why, Sir, you are insupportable!</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i> (<i>smiling</i>). I see&mdash;a joke&mdash;very
    good! But, my dear Sir, do you think it quite dignified to make
    so small a jest in my presence? It is calculated to lessen my
    respect for you.</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. Well I never!</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i>. Never what? You have not completed the
    sentence.</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. Sir, you are an insolent young puppy!</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i>. I am forced to contradict you&mdash;in justice
    to yourself. You cannot be willing to let me regard you as a
    dog?</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. (<i>after a pause</i>). Well, the sooner you
    get back to the school the better.</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i> (<i>promptly</i>). I have no doubt you are
    right, my dear Father; and, as I take a sincere interest in
    your welfare, I would respectfully suggest that you should
    accompany me. It must be patent to us both that you are lacking
    in polish.</p>

    <p><i>Pater</i>. (<i>losing his patience</i>). You young cub! I
    will give you the soundest thrashing you ever had in your
    life!</p>

    <p><i>Materfamilias</i> (<i>interposing</i>). Oh, you cruel
    man! What has the poor child done?</p>

    <p><i>Jacky</i> (<i>with ready tact</i>). Nothing, dearest
    Mamma, except to take after his kind, clever and accomplished
    Mother!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
